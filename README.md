# odin-recipes
The current project is to create a website from scratch using just HTML.
The website will contain different meals and hyper-links underneath
those meals that take the user to that respective meals recipe.

At the end of this project I hope to feel more comfortable and familiar with 
HTML, so I can later use CSS to make the website more appealing to the user.
